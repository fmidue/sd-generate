All examples are transformed from Haskell examples.

Restriction:
1. PlantUML does not support any non-standard (non-default) entry or exit for concurrent states (Regions States), so in Haskell examples, only Concurrent states (Regions States) without any non-standard (non-default) entry or exit can be transformed, otherwise it causes errors.

2. Setting a name for regions, but not for a regions state seems infeasible.

3. Two kinds of arrows "->" (right arrows) and "-->" (down arrows). "->" is priorly layouted in a horizontal(right) direction and "-->" is priorly layouted in a vertical(down) direction. In the transformation, only transitions leaving from start states use "->", others use "-->".

4. Two kinds of region layouts "--" and "||". It has no automatic selection rule like the Haskell tool. After testing, "--" is chosen because of its better drawing effect.
